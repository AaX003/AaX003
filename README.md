### Who am I  
<div>Hi there! My name is AXACODES (or AaXanah if you want to get personal) and I'm an aspiring software developer with a passion for building and designing web applications! I've been coding for almost three years now and while I'm still learning, I've definitely enjoyed the journey and all of the milestones I have achieved! I hope you'll enjoy being on the journey with me! </div>  
  

### About Me  
My software development journey started during college. Initially, I used to *hate* coding because I thought I wasn't good at it. I often compared my programs with others and convinced myself I wasn't good enough. However, my perspective started to shift after realizing my code didn't have to be perfect, not when I was just starting out. When striving to become better at something, you should never aim for **perfection**, but **progress**. As of now, I'm constantly experimenting, creating, and learning, and I hope my journey inspires other new developers to take that first step like how I did!

### 🏆 Achievements  
- 🎓 Acquired my bachelor's degree in computer science with a concentration in software development, achieving the rank of Summa Cum Laude at my respective school.
- 💼 Completed several extern software-related positions at a company under my respective school, meeting new people and expanding my skills, particularly in mobile development, game mechanics & animations, UI design, and more.
- 📜 Earned several certifications under Alison, demonstrating my proficiency in various outlets such as UI design, Python, Github Fundamentals, and more!
- 🧩 Successfully completed and posted ~20 projects on my online portfolio, demonstrating the versatility in my skills.
- 📃 Founded AXACODES, a small software development brand that focuses on creativity, accessibility, and versatility.


### 💪 Future Endeavors  
- 🤝 Actively participate in open-source communities and challenges such as Hackathons, GitHub repositories, and more.
- 🧑‍🏫 Provide teachings to others who inspire to code. 
- 🧰 Continue building and designing scalable digital solutions that not only enhance enjoyability, but practicality, specifically for those who may lack it elsewhere. 
- 📱 Build an app where I can combine assistance for those who struggle with time/task management and depressive symptoms. 
- 🌟 Make my family proud!
